A fictional Landing Page that I built with HTML5 and CSS3, i got this idea from: https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

What i learned/improved with this projetc: 

- I mixed Flexbox with CSS Grid, and it worked very well
- For the first time i used reset.css instead of normalize.css, and I really enjoyed to build the layout without the default broswer styles.
